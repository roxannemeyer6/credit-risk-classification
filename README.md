# credit-risk-classification
  This is for the module 20 challenge.
  In this Challenge, I used various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk.   
  I then used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
